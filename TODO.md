## Technical Debt

### 🔴 Connection Resilience (Slow/Unreliable Networks)
- [x] **Save streaming responses on connection failure** - Implemented via cleanup thread that saves message to DB even if client disconnects mid-stream. See `cleanup_and_save()` in routes.py.
- [x] **Push title updates in streaming `done` event** - The `done` SSE event now includes `title` field when a title is auto-generated. Client uses title directly from response, falling back to API call only if not present.
- [x] **Add retry logic for failed API calls** - Frontend automatically retries GET requests with exponential backoff. POST requests show toast with manual retry button.
- [ ] **Detect and handle offline state** - Show offline indicator when network is unavailable. Queue messages locally and sync when connection returns.
- [ ] **Handle partial file uploads** - Large file uploads can fail mid-transfer. Consider chunked uploads with resume capability, or at minimum show clear error and allow retry.
- [ ] **Add connection quality indicator** - Show visual feedback when connection is slow (e.g., SSE keepalives arriving but no tokens for extended period).
- [x] **Handle stale JWT on reconnect** - Frontend detects `AUTH_EXPIRED` error code and shows toast prompting re-login instead of failing silently.
- [x] **Persist unsent messages locally** - Draft messages preserved in store and restored on send failure.
- [ ] **Real-time data synchronization** - Implement mechanism to notify clients about new data (e.g., messages appearing in a chat after losing connectivity, new conversations created on different devices). Options: WebSockets for bidirectional, SSE for server-to-client updates, or polling with efficient change detection. Should handle reconnection and sync missed updates.

### 🔴 Critical / High Priority
- [ ] **Replace assert statements with proper error handling** - `routes.py` uses `assert user is not None` after `@require_auth` which can be disabled with Python `-O` flag. Replace with explicit error responses.
- [x] **Add backend test suite** - Created `tests/` directory with unit and integration tests covering auth, API routes, database, tools, and utilities.
- [x] **Add frontend test suite** - Created `web/tests/` with Vitest (unit/component) and Playwright (E2E/visual) tests. Mock server for E2E tests in `tests/e2e-server.py`.
- [x] **Catch specific exceptions** - Replaced bare `except Exception:` with specific exceptions (`binascii.Error`, `DDGSException`, `genai_errors.ClientError`, etc.) where appropriate. Kept broad handlers only for top-level error recovery (streaming threads, request handlers).

### 🟠 Security
- [ ] **Add server-side file type validation** - File upload relies on client MIME type. Add magic bytes verification using `python-magic`.
- [ ] **Add request size limits** - Enforce request body size limits in Flask to prevent DoS
- [x] **Improve JWT token handling** - Added token refresh mechanism (proactive refresh when 2 days remain) and enforced minimum secret length (32+ chars in production)
- [ ] **Add CORS configuration** - Explicitly configure CORS if needed for cross-origin requests

### 🟡 Code Quality
- [x] Add proper database migrations (yoyo-migrations)
- [x] Add request validation (pydantic or marshmallow) - Implemented Pydantic v2 with `@validate_request` decorator
- [ ] Consider async Flask (quart) for better concurrency
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **Store files and thumbnails outside DB** - Move file data and thumbnails to object storage (S3, MinIO, etc.) for better scalability and performance
- [x] **Split JavaScript into modules** - Migrated to Vite + TypeScript with modular components in `web/src/`
- [x] **Add structured logging** - Replace print statements with proper logging framework (Python logging module). Currently `images.py:69` uses `print()`.
- [x] **Error handling standardization** - Consistent error response format with ErrorCode enum, retryable flag, and structured responses across all API endpoints
- [x] **Frontend error boundaries** - ApiError class with error categorization, retry logic for GET requests, toast notifications for all API errors
- [x] **Remove inline onclick handlers** - Migrated to event delegation in TypeScript components
- [x] **Add request timeout handling** - CHAT_TIMEOUT (5 min) for batch requests, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (30s) for other requests. Streaming needs per-read timeout (TODO).
- [x] **TypeScript migration** - Frontend migrated to TypeScript with strict mode
- [x] **Extract magic numbers and strings to constants** - Created centralized `constants.{ts,py}` for unit conversions and `config.{ts,py}` for developer-configurable values. See CLAUDE.md "Constants and Configuration" section for guidelines.
- [x] **Remove console.log statements** - Implemented structured frontend logging in `web/src/utils/logger.ts` with `createLogger()` factory. All console statements replaced with structured logs. See CLAUDE.md "Frontend Logging" section.
- [x] **Reduce innerHTML usage** - Added `clearElement()` helper to replace `innerHTML = ''`. Documented acceptable vs avoidable innerHTML patterns in AGENTS.md. Remaining innerHTML uses are legitimate (SVG icons, markdown rendering, complex HTML structures).
- [ ] **Audit unused CSS classes** - After TypeScript migration, review and remove unused CSS classes from main.css
- [ ] **Create design system / color palette** - Consolidate purple/blue shades into named CSS variables. Currently using multiple similar colors: `--accent` (#6366f1), `--accent-hover` (#818cf8), `--user-bg` (#2563eb), version banner (#3730a3, #1e1b4b), assistant avatar gradient. Define a consistent palette with semantic names.

### 🟢 Database
- [ ] **Database connection pooling** - Consider connection pooling for SQLite (though SQLite has limitations)
- [x] **Add database indexes** - Add indexes on frequently queried columns (conversations.user_id, messages.conversation_id, etc.)
- [x] **Add database query optimization** - Review and optimize N+1 query patterns (e.g., loading conversations with message counts) - Reviewed, no N+1 patterns found
- [ ] **Pagination for conversations** - Add pagination to conversations list endpoint for users with many conversations
- [ ] **Add database backup automation** - Automated daily backups of SQLite database
- [ ] **Add database vacuum** - Periodic SQLite VACUUM to reclaim space and optimize database
- [x] **Add database query logging** - Log slow queries for optimization (in development/debug mode)
- [x] **Add database connectivity check** - Verify database is accessible at startup with clear error message

### 🔵 Frontend Performance & UX
- [x] **Allow switching conversations without interrupting active requests/SSE** - Requests continue in background when switching conversations. UI guards with `isCurrentConversation` checks prevent updates to wrong conversation. See "Concurrent Request Handling" in CLAUDE.md.
- [ ] **iPad Safari keyboard bar gap** - When focusing input on iPad with external keyboard, the system keyboard accessory bar pushes content up, revealing a gap below the app. CSS cannot paint outside the viewport iOS reveals. Need to investigate workarounds.
- [x] **Replace native browser dialogs** - Custom Modal component (showAlert, showConfirm, showPrompt) replaces all native dialogs. Toast notifications for transient messages.
- [x] **Frontend bundle optimization** - Migrated to Vite, bundles marked.js and highlight.js from npm
- [ ] **Add service worker** - Implement service worker for offline support and better caching
- [ ] **Add file upload progress** - Show upload progress indicator for large file uploads
- [ ] **Accessibility improvements** - Add ARIA labels, improve keyboard navigation, ensure screen reader compatibility
- [x] **Frontend state management** - Migrated to Zustand for state management
- [ ] **Frontend code splitting** - Split frontend code into chunks for better initial load performance
- [ ] **Frontend error reporting** - Add error reporting service (Sentry, Rollbar) for production error tracking
- [ ] **Frontend performance monitoring** - Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals, custom metrics)
- [ ] **Frontend bundle analysis** - Analyze bundle size and identify optimization opportunities

### ⚙️ Configuration & Operations
- [x] **Environment variable validation** - Validate all required env vars at startup with clear error messages
- [x] **Add health check endpoint** - `/api/health` (liveness) and `/api/ready` (readiness) endpoints for monitoring and load balancer checks
- [x] **Add request/response logging middleware** - Log all API requests and responses (with sensitive data redaction)
- [x] **Add request ID tracking** - Include request IDs in logs and error responses for easier debugging
- [x] **Add API response compression** - Enable gzip compression via nginx (see README deployment section)
- [ ] **Remove unused dependencies** - Audit and remove any unused npm/Python dependencies
- [ ] **Optimize image processing** - Consider async/background processing for thumbnail generation on large images
- [x] **Make HTTP timeout configurable** - `tools.py` uses `Config.TOOL_TIMEOUT` (default 90s)
- [x] **Make thumbnail dimensions configurable** - `Config.THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE` (default 400x400) and `Config.THUMBNAIL_QUALITY` (default 85)

## Notes

### Gemini API Data Privacy
- Logs are NOT used for training by default on billing-enabled projects
- Logs auto-expire after 55 days
- No explicit opt-out parameter, but data sharing requires explicit opt-in

### Model IDs (as of Dec 2025)
- `gemini-3-pro-preview` - Best for complex reasoning
- `gemini-3-flash-preview` - Faster and cheaper

### Thinking Level Parameter
Gemini 3 uses `thinking_level` instead of `thinking_budget`:
- `minimal` - Fastest, least reasoning
- `low` - Good for simple tasks
- `medium` - Balanced
- `high` - Maximum reasoning depth (default)
